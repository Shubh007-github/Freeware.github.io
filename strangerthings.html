          <h4> Stranger Things 2, the second season of the Netflix original Stranger Things, was released on October 27, 2017. It consists of nine episodes ranging from forty-five to sixty-two minutes in length.

            Stranger Things 2 was confirmed by Netflix on August 31, 2016 for a 2017 release. An announcement trailer revealed that the second season consisted of nine episodes as well as showing the working title for each episode.[1] Filming of the season started in Atlanta, Georgia on November 7, 2016.[2]
            
            Set in Hawkins in the fall of 1984, the story continues as supernatural forces once again begin to affect the town.[3] While the season services the first season's core cast and characters first and foremost,[4] several new characters are introduced: tomboy Max and her older step-brother Billy, a girl named Kali  connected to Hawkins Lab, RadioShack  manager Bob Newby, Department of Energy  agent Dr. Owens and disgraced journalist-turned-conspiracy theorist Murray Bauman.[3][5][6] Similar to the previous season, Season 2 was lauded by critics and audiences alike and was praised for being much more horror-oriented.
